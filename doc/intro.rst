Introduction
============

Warp is a web framework based on `Twisted Web`_, using the `Storm`_ ORM,
`Mako`_ templating, and `jQuery`_.

It's designed to be batteries-included (auth, sessions, URL routing, CRUD,
access control, etc), easy to get started with, and capable of leveraging all
the power of `Twisted`_.

.. _jQuery: http://jquery.com/


Warp is currently being developed by `Cogini`_, but it's `open source
<http://github.com/cogini/warp/>`_ and help is more than welcome.

It was originally written by Brendon Hogger for Cogini.
